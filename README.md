# Definitions
## Heuristic function
Currently, heuristic is most often used as an adjective, referring to any technique
that improves the average-case performance on a problem-solving task, but does
not necessarily improve the worst-case performance. In the specific area of search
algorithms, it refers to a function that provides an estimate of solution cost.

## contingency problem

## Pruning 
allows us to ignore portions of the search tree that make no difference to the final choice

## heuristic evaluation functions
allow us to approximate the true utility of a state without doing a complete search
