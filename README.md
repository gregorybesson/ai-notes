# Definitions
## Heuristic function
Currently, heuristic is most often used as an adjective, referring to any technique
that improves the average-case performance on a problem-solving task, but does
not necessarily improve the worst-case performance. In the specific area of search
algorithms, it refers to a function that provides an estimate of solution cost.
